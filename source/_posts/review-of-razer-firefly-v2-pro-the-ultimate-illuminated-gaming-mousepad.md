## Review of Razer Firefly V2 Pro: The Ultimate Illuminated Gaming Mousepad

### Key Takeaways

* Razer Firefly V2 Pro offers edge-to-edge RGB lighting for a premium price of $99.99.
* The mousepad can be easily set up and features an integrated USB-A port.
* Offers customizable lighting effects through Razer Synapse 3 Windows software.

 The [Razer Firefly V2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Firefly-Fully-Illuminated-Gaming/dp/B0CY6RJRBR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-firefly-v2-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) delivers pizzaz with customizable edge-to-edge RGB backlighting. Of course, no matter how fancy the mousepad is, if it doesn't also provide optimal mouse tracking and control, it's a useless decoration. Fortunately, the Firefly V2 Pro is more than just a fancy light show.

 At the top rear of the Firefly V2 Pro is a USB-C port, as well as a USB-A port. You plug the included USB-C to USB-A cable into the USB-C port on the back of the mousepad and then the USB-A port into your Windows 10 or 11 computer. The integrated USB-A 2.0 port on the mousepad can then be used to plug in a mouse or keyboard, wired or wireless. In my case, I plugged in the USB dongle from my [Logitech G915 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-LIGHTSYNC-LIGHTSPEED-Bluetooth/dp/B07NY9ZWXQ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1%5Fsspa?crid=N0CF2U4V7H88&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2MH76OpA6JW0vl6IjNJjESXpBDZO-xfK4MTGKwWP8UQ-wHC4H-Ikm02OZQ1U892301d10o4Dbd-qO7UtMLt2-0BEug8OGps2dcMKMLilJevVKv5rUAUZOvmwP4nTHvkgFttS3Kh6y5wZ823DpyVVE59NPUoNVOxb4dYQW6aGKNgTOzhihPrtMtZX-jx3yzCqMAu-A%5FnqRu4XJAG7GTD9Kux9Q8PLNe8sHU3vQODlOWg.jT7uYomfJ4ejxWjavR5ObE1FYkoV5GdD2xI-jR6jA1w&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=logitech%2Bg915&qid=1716564487&sprefix=logitech%2Bg915%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-1-spons&sp%5Fcsd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-firefly-v2-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) and noted no performance issues.

 The Firefly V2 Pro is part of Razer's [Gamer Room](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fpc%2Fgamer-room) line, which includes other accessories and lights that all use the same [Razer Synapse 3](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fsynapse-3) software for control. As noted in my review of the [Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/navigating-electronic-invoicing-expert-tips-for-the-accounts-payable-department-with-abbyy/), the app provides easy control over the RGB LEDs, which can be set to a specific brightness, various preset effects, and programmable advanced effects.

 Although you don't have quite as many options as you get with some of the other Gamer Room products, you can set the Firefly V2 Pro to react to audio, breathing colors, match a portion of the display, color cycle, color wave, or stay at a single color. You can also use the Chroma Studio option within Razer Synapse to design your own effects.

 Personally, I prefer keeping a 100% brightness static red color, which I also set my keyboard and some other lights to, which illuminate without affecting the rods in my eyes, allowing me to see the screen and environmental details without being distracting. Similarly, the mouse pad can be set to turn its lights off when the display is off, such as when your computer goes to sleep, and then wakes up as soon as the display goes back on.

 As with other Gamer Room products, the Firefly V2 Pro can react to events in specific games. While the [game list](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fchroma-workshop%23--games) isn't particularly long, when a game is supported, the effects can be quite fun to experience. For instance, in "Baldur's Gate 3," among other effects, the mousepad's colors will change depending upon the success or failure of a dice roll. Since the lighting is literally on your desktop and by your hand, it's not as noticeable as something like the Aether Monitor Light Bar or [Aether Lamp Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Aether-Lamp-Pro-Multi-Zone-PC/dp/B0CHWPHNPQ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-firefly-v2-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), but it's still a nice option to have and does work well in concert with those other devices.

## **Performance**

 Whether soft, such as cloth, or hard, such as glass, there are a wide variety of mouse pad surfaces available. Although not glass, the polycarbonate surface on the Firefly V2 Pro reminds me a lot of my [Gcsyo Glass Gaming Mousepad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BG86HBDL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-firefly-v2-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), just not as cool to the touch. The Firefly V2 Pro's surface has a slight grit to it, both allowing for excellent tracking and for my mouse's PTFE feet to glide smoothly. Although it may be a tight fit on some desktops, its generous 14.17- by 10.95-inch dimensions mean you have plenty of surface to mouse around on.

 In terms of lighting, I found it to be bright and even. The ring outside the surrounding surface is naturally the brightest and similar to the lower-end [Firefly Hard V2 mouse pad](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Firefly-Gaming-Mouse-Built/dp/B07ZDWHL4M/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1RPPWERAFM3DO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OLXAaYQXLqOal3UKTxkPtDXcuGVgLimQE007oNvvE4uiY8XvC4ObuvM5hZRH9l0zqmWyB714ut%5FkidDfkCI%5FUwJl0D4zOXtqWk6%5FO5vIGx8quWefebE5h3t9boihEemT%5Fyvbyr5fUVMDK5a2El4Qilkvhk7SoQUEduQQvQTYK5OCFOPmA%5F3VOv8zSJFPbqQ6c7qsAsxlvYRKaGsm2PBQOuKzdtopMHnR2jXkhPn2UP8.g0R3lQA%5FgVw0YKosvRi4y1RifnR0rJdrHj2QHEF1JHE&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=razer%2Bfirefly%2Bmouse%2Bpad&qid=1716567175&s=electronics&sprefix=razer%2Bfirefly%2Bmouse%2Bpad%2Celectronics%2C127&sr=1-1&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-firefly-v2-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority), but the big differentiator is that, thanks to its 15-zone lighting, the colors go across the entirety of the darkened mouse pad surface. While it doesn't look quite as impressive in a bright room, and certain colors, such as green, pop better than others, Razer has done a fantastic job balancing the surface quality with the lighting effects.

## **Should You Buy the Razer Firefly V2 Pro?** 

 Not everyone will want to invest $100 on a mouse pad like this, but for the gamer or RGB lighting enthusiast who can afford it, this makes a great addition to your gaming station. While it would have been nice for the [Razer Firefly V2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Firefly-Fully-Illuminated-Gaming/dp/B0CY6RJRBR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003319&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-firefly-v2-pro-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) to offer wireless charging amongst its features at this price point, the fact that it duplicates the USB-A port that it takes up means it has a low impact on your available ports.

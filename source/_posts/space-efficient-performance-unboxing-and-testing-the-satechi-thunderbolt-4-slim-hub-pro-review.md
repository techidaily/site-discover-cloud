## Space-Efficient Performance: Unboxing and Testing the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro Review

### Key Takeaways

* The Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro is great for dual-screen setups, and quick-charging devices on the go.
* It has a portable design with 96W power delivery, and up to 40Gbps data transfer.
* The Hub Pro lacks HDMI and DisplayPort connections which might keep it from being a universal dock for everyone.

 The [Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro](http://satechi.net/products/thunderbolt-4-slim-hub-pro) is pretty affordable when compared to the Thunderbolt hub competition, but it's also sneakily specialized. Students, graphic designers, and video editors should adore its simple design and powerful ports, even if it's not for everyone.

##  Design: A Hub that Fits in the Palm of Your Hand![Front view of the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro displaying the USB-A and USB-C ports](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/front-view-of-the-satechi-thunderbolt-4-slim-hub-pro-displaying-the-usb-a-and-pc-connection-slotjpg_53483846357_o.jpg) 

 I’ve reviewed a handful of Satechi hubs and [docks](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-apple-iphone-13-mini-to-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) over the last couple of years, and one thing I’m always impressed about is the company’s design-forward approach. The Slim Hub Pro is built to only take up a minimal amount of your workstation space. An aircraft-grade aluminum covers most of the chassis, save for the black trimming where the front and back ports are located. I liked its sophisticated look, but I didn't have much of a choice since it only comes in Space Gray.

 Speaking of connections: The front of the Slim Hub Pro features a single downstream Thunderbolt 4 (TB4) port, and one USB-A connection. There are three upstream TB4 ports on the back, along with a DC power port.

 Flipping the hub over reveals four rubber stoppers, ensuring your Slim Hub Pro won’t slip around on desks and tables, and that your surfaces won’t get scuffed or scratched.

 At 12.20 inches wide, 0.72 inches tall, 2.91 inches from front to back, and weighing 0.53 pounds, portability is a major selling point for this TB4 hub. It’s small enough to tuck into just about any backpack or laptop sleeve. I’m also betting most folks can handle the Slim Hub Pro with just one hand.

 Besides the Slim Pro Hub itself, other box contents should include a 28-inch TB4 host cable, a power adapter, and a power cable.

##  Features: Good for Mac, Better for Windows

 The Slim Hub Pro has a lot going for it, but there are also a few features I wish Satechi had implemented. Billed as a TB4 hub, the front-facing [USB-C](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/) port features 96W Power Delivery. If you’re using a modern laptop with a big battery, the Slim Hub Pro should do an excellent job at keeping your battery topped off.

 The three rear-facing TB4 ports are backward compatible with [Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C standards](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-definitive-guide-to-the-elite-samsung-galaxy-tab-s7plus-and-its-unmatched-android-performance/). Each of these upstream connections can push up to 40Gbps, and provide up to 15W of charging power, which is ideal for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.

 As far as video output goes, you can use the Slim Hub Pro for both single and dual-monitor setups. If you’re running it into two USB-C monitors, the resolution and frame rate are capped at 4K/60Hz. If you’re using a Windows computer, you can use one of the three upstream ports to push a maximum output of 8K/30Hz.

 Unfortunately, this 8K capability isn’t compatible with macOS systems. You’ll also need to be using macOS 11 or higher for the Slim Hub Pro to work at all.

##  Using the Slim Hub Pro: HDMI and DisplayPort, Please

![Close up of the LED power indicator on the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/close-up-of-the-led-power-indicator-on-the-satechi-thunderbolt-4-slim-hub-projpg_53485056584_o.jpg)

 The Slim Hub Pro is best used as a grab-and-go component for pop-up workstations—I think. One scenario would be something as simple as setting up shop at a cafe for a couple of hours. Once you’re plugged in, the Slim Hub Pro will quickly charge your laptop and smartphone, while supplying power to an external HDD.

 I used the hub in my home office as a glorified [USB power station](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), so I can attest to the Slim Hub Pro’s fast charging capabilities. Connected to the 96W host port, my late 2020 M1 MacBook Pro received a 50% boost in battery in about half an hour.

 It was just as convenient to charge my iPhone 12 and AirPods Pro case. Do note that the rear-facing ports are capped at 15W. I didn’t mind the _slightly_ slower recharge time for mobile devices, but a product like the Plugable 11-in-1 Dual HDMI Docking Station would better serve those looking for a quick-charge hub.

 If you’re trying to build more of a permanent workstation around the Slim Hub Pro, you’ll want to make sure your monitors are TB4 or USB-C compliant for the best compatibility. I mentioned that the Slim Hub Pro doesn’t support 8K for macOS. This might be okay for most folks, but graphic designers and video editors who exclusively use Apple hardware may not be too happy.

 Spec-wise, I do think the Slim Hub Pro is pretty good for gaming. Something to keep in mind is that the upstream TB4 ports are capped at 32Gbps when powering an external GPU. Personally, if I were shopping for a gaming hub, I’d also want it to have at least two different types of video outputs.

 In the case of the Slim Hub Pro, you _could_ add a USB-C hub with whatever video connections you need (HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.) to one of the upstream TB4 ports, but that starts to against the space-saving design of the Slim Hub Pro.

##  Should You Buy the Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Pro Hub?

 The best thing about the [Satechi Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro](https://satechi.net/products/thunderbolt-4-slim-hub-pro?variant=40898623471704&currency=USD&utm%5Fmedium=product%5Fsync&utm%5Fsource=google&utm%5Fcontent=sag%5Forganic&utm%5Fcampaign=sag%5Forganic&tw%5Fsource=google&tw%5Fadid=&tw%5Fcampaign=20795600336&gad%5Fsource=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA6KWvBhAREiwAFPZM7jcJMOTuy7umIbb-AwfnuHGPExnDo65dXBySqEmUvUctA6nV08oPUxoCwIgQAvD%5FBwE) is how small it is. If you’re looking for a hub that’s simple to take and use anywhere, and you don’t need HDMI, DisplayPort, or SD card slots, the Slim Hub Pro makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, I’d recommend looking for TB4 hubs with _at least_ one extra type of video output.
